in cash or certified funds; and if not so paid, the Trustee reserves the right
to retain the deposit and resell the Properties at the risk and cost of the
defaulting purchaser, after such advertisement and on such terms as the Trustee
may deem proper, and to avail himself and the Lender of any legal or equitable
rights against the defaulting purchaser, including, without limitation, the
recovery of all of Lender's costs, expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees to
conduct both sales, plus any deficiency resulting from such subsequent sale and
the cost of collecting same. The Properties are sold subject to the rights, if
any, of any parties in possession, if such rights have priority over the Deed of
Trust, and to any and all covenants, conditions, restrictions, easements, rights
of way, and limitations of record. The Properties will be sold ""WHERE IS"" and in
""AS IS"" condition without any warranty as to condition, express or implied, and

other casualty to the Properties from and after the date of sale will be upon

forfeited deposit shall be applied against the outstanding balance of the debt
secured by the Deed of Trust, as determined by the Trustee, unless expressly
prohibited by statute, court rule or the Deed of Trust. The Trustee may then
readvertise and resell the Property at the risk and cost of the defaulting
purchaser (such risk and cost shall include any attorney's fees or costs in
connection with all litigation, including appeals, involving the Property or the
proceeds of a resale; or contesting the Selling Parties' right to conduct a
resale; or seeking to invalidate this sale unless expressly prohibited by

received any 'rent' from any occupant or tenant of the Property such amount
received shall be promptly delivered to the Trustee; or, without reselling the
Property, the Trustee may avail himself of any legal or equitable remedies
against the defaulting purchaser). In the event of a resale, the defaulting
purchaser shall not be entitled to receive the surplus, if any, even if such
surplus results from improvements to the Property by said defaulting purchaser.

the purchaser is also the party secured by the said Deed of Trust, payment of
the required deposit and purchase price is made by crediting the amount thereof
to the indebtedness. The balance in cash or immediately available funds, with
interest at six and forty-nine hundredths per centum (6.49%) per annum from the

implied, specifically including marketability or insurability (hazard or title),
unless otherwise required by statute, court rule or the Deed of Trust. In the
event the Trustee is unable for any reason to convey title, the purchaser's sole
remedy at law or in equity shall be to request and receive a return of the
deposit. Upon return of the deposit, this sale shall be void and of no effect
and the purchaser shall have no further claim against the Trustee. Compliance
with terms of sale shall be made within thirty (30) days after the date of sale
or the deposit shall be forfeited. In the event of a default, all expenses of
this sale (including attorney's fees and trustee's commission) shall be charged
against and paid out of the forfeited deposit, and any remaining balance of the
forfeited deposit shall be applied against the outstanding balance of the debt
secured by the Deed of Trust, as determined by the Trustee, unless expressly
prohibited by statute, court rule or the Deed of Trust. The Trustee may then
readvertise and resell the Property at the risk and cost of the defaulting
purchaser (such risk and cost shall include any attorney's fees or costs in
connection with all litigation, including appeals, involving the Property or the
proceeds of a resale; or contesting the Selling Parties' right to conduct a
resale; or seeking to invalidate this sale unless expressly prohibited by
statute, court rule or the Deed of Trust; and, if the defaulting purchaser has
received any 'rent' from any occupant or tenant of the Property such amount
received shall be promptly delivered to the Trustee; or, without reselling the
Property, the Trustee may avail himself of any legal or equitable remedies
against the defaulting purchaser). In the event of a resale, the defaulting
purchaser shall not be entitled to receive the surplus, if any, even if such
surplus results from improvements to the Property by said defaulting purchaser.

waives any and all claims, rights, and interest in any such excess amounts and
shall not be entitled to any distribution whatsoever from the resale proceeds.
The parties' respective rights and obligations regarding the terms of sale and

OPEN FOR PUBLIC COMMENT WASHINGTON, DC The District of Columbia Water and Sewer
Authority (DC Water) is proposing to construct the Piney Branch Tunnel Project
within Rock Creek Park in northwest Washington, DC. The Project is a major
component to be implemented as part of DC Water's Long Term Control Plan, also
known as the DC Clean Rivers Project. DC Water estimates nearly 40 million
gallons of stormwater combined with sanitary sewage overflow into Piney Branch
every year. These combined sewer overflows, or CSOs, contribute to water quality
degradation of Piney Branch, Rock Creek and ultimately the Potomac River and the
Chesapeake Bay. The proposed Piney Branch Tunnel Project would capture most of
these CSOs so they can be treated at the Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater
Treatment Plant before being discharged into the Potomac River. DC Water
estimates that the Piney Branch Tunnel would reduce untreated CSOs into Piney
Branch by 96% by volume and limit CSO frequency from 25 to one in a year of
average rainfall. NOTICE OF AVAILABILITY The National Park Service and DC Water
are seeking public comments on an Environmental Assessment (EA) prepared
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The EA will be
available for public review and comment from October 15, 2024, to December 6,
2024. To view or download the EA, or to submit comments online, visit

cashier's check or immediate funds wire transfer to the Substitute Trustees. The
party secured by the Deed of Trust (the ""Secured Party"") or any affiliate
thereof, if a bidder, is not required to post a deposit or to pay interest on
the unpaid purchase money. If the Secured Party purchases the Property at the
sale, the amount bid by the Secured Party, after deducting all expenses related
to the sale, shall be a credit against the indebtedness secured by the Deed of
Trust. The balance of the purchase price, with interest at the rate set forth in
the Promissory Note, shall be paid by cash, cashier's check, or another
acceptable form at settlement, which must occur within thirty (30) days
following the sale. Interest will accrue from the date of sale until the date
funds are received by NM Commercial Title, LLC, the closing agent for the
Substitute Trustees. There shall be no abatement of interest if settlement is
delayed. The purchaser of the Property shall be responsible for all condominium
or homeowners' association fees and unpaid real property taxes due with respect
to the Property, and all amounts due in connection therewith and there shall be
no adjustment therefor. All water and sewer charges, and all other charges and
assessments against the Property shall be the responsibility of the purchaser
and there shall be no adjustment therefor. The purchaser shall pay all closing
costs of the sale. All obligations of the purchaser hereunder shall survive
closing and delivery of the deed. The purchaser (other than the Secured Party)
shall sign a contract including this advertisement and other terms. Time is of
the essence. The purchaser shall deliver to the Substitute Trustees, within two
(2) business days following the sale, an insurance certificate confirming that
the purchaser has obtained casualty and liability insurance coverage on the
Property, naming the Substitute Trustees and the Secured Party as additional
insured parties on the policy, and otherwise in form and content acceptable to
the Substitute Trustees. The failure of the purchaser to provide such evidence
of insurance coverage shall constitute grounds for nullifying and voiding the
sale. The Substitute Trustees reserve the right to require registration and/or
pre-qualification of bidders, to modify or waive the requirements for bidders'
deposits, to approve the creditworthiness of any bidder, to withdraw the
Property from sale, to cancel the sale, to use an agent or attorney to conduct
the sale, to reject any and all bids or to postpone the sale and keep the
bidding open for any length of time. If the purchaser defaults, the Substitute
Trustees may retain the deposit as liquidated damages, resell the Property at
the risk and cost of the defaulting purchaser, and recover any deficiency in the
purchase price, all costs and expenses of both sales, attorneys' fees, and
related expenses, or may avail themselves of any other legal or equitable
remedies available to them. The defaulting purchaser is not entitled to any
surplus from the resale, even if such surplus is due to improvements made by the
defaulting purchaser. If the Substitute Trustees are unable to convey the
Property by reason of any defect in the title or otherwise, the sole remedy of
the purchaser of the Property at law or in equity shall be the refund of the
deposit. Upon refund of the deposit to the purchaser, the sale shall be void and
of no effect. The conveyance by the Substitute Trustees to the purchaser at
settlement shall be by Substitute Trustees' Deed, without covenant or warranty.

thereof, is the successful bidder at the sale, such party will not be required
to make a deposit or to pay interest on the unpaid purchase money. The Property
will be sold subject to all taxes, ground rent, water rent, condominium fees
and/or homeowner association dues, all public charges/assessments payable on an
annual basis, including sanitary and/or metropolitan district charges, if
applicable, all of which shall be the sole responsibility of the purchaser(s).
The cost of all documentary stamps, recordation taxes, document preparation, and
transfer taxes is to be paid by the purchaser(s). The Trustees reserve the right
to reject any and all bids and to extend the time for settlement, at their
discretion. The Property will be sold in an ""AS IS"" condition and without any
warranties or representations, either express or implied, as to the nature,
condition, or description of the improvements. In addition, the Property will
also be sold subject to all existing housing, building, and zoning code
violations, subject to all critical area and wetland violations, subject to all
environmental problems and violations which may exist with respect to the
Property, and subject to all matters and restrictions of record affecting the
same, if any. The purchaser(s) at the foreclosure sale shall assume the risk of
loss for the Property immediately after the sale takes place. It shall be the
purchaser(s)' responsibility to obtain possession of the Property. The Property
will be sold subject to all senior liens and encumbrances that are not
extinguished by operation of law or by the foreclosure sale of the Property and
subject to all easements, conditions, restrictions, rights of redemption,
covenants, such state of facts that an accurate survey or physical inspection of
the Property might disclose, and agreements of record affecting the Property.

documentary stamps, recordation taxes and fees, title examination costs,
attorneys' fees, conveyance fees, and all other incidental settlement costs. The
purchaser(s) shall settle and comply with the terms of sale within thirty (30)
days following the day of the sale, unless said period is extended by the
Trustees for good cause shown. Time is of the essence. Settlement shall be held
at the offices of Funk & Bolton, P.A., 100 Light Street, Suite 1400, Baltimore,
Maryland 21202. In the event the purchaser(s) fail to go to settlement as
required, in addition to any other legal or equitable remedies available to
them, the Trustees may, without further order of the court, declare the
aforementioned deposit forfeited and re-sell the Property at the purchaser(s)'
risk and expense. In such event, the defaulting purchaser(s) shall be liable for
the payment of any deficiency in the purchase price, all costs and expenses of
both sales, reasonable attorneys' fees, all other charges due, and incidental
damages. In the event the resale of the Property results in a sale in excess of
the amount originally bid by the defaulting purchaser, the defaulting purchaser
waives any and all claims, rights, and interest in any such excess amounts and
shall not be entitled to any distribution whatsoever from the resale proceeds.
The parties' respective rights and obligations regarding the terms of sale and
the conduct of the sale shall be governed by and interpreted according to the
laws of the District of Columbia. If the Trustees are unable to convey the
Property as described above, the purchaser(s)' sole remedy at law or in equity
shall be limited to the refund of the aforementioned deposit, without interest
thereon. Upon refund of the deposit to the purchaser(s), the sale shall be void
and of no effect, and the purchaser(s) shall have no further claim against the
Trustees or the Noteholder. The information contained herein was obtained from
sources deemed to be reliable, but is offered for informational purposes only.

the Condominium may not waive its super priority lien. The above notice has been
sent to all lienholders, and at the time of sale, the Trustee will announce
whether the super-priority lien has been satisfied. If the super priority lien
is satisfied, then the sale will proceed subject to all prior liens,
encumbrances, and/or municipal assessments if any, including the first deed of

to the District of Columbia Code Section 42-1903.13, the Condominium is

all interest in the limited common elements appertaining to said Condominium
Unit as described in the Declaration of FAIRFAX VILLAGE CONDOMINIUM II, is the
property conveyed to Emily J. Andrews-Chevis by Deed recorded on 4/12/01 as
Instrument No. 2001034869. TERMS OF SALE: Pursuant to the ruling of the Court of
Appeals in Liu v. US Bank, N.A., the Condominium may not waive its super
priority lien. The above notice has been sent to all lienholders, and at the
time of sale, the Trustee will announce whether the super-priority lien has been
satisfied. If the super priority lien is satisfied, then the sale will proceed
subject to all prior liens, encumbrances, and/or municipal assessments if any,
including the first deed of trust. If the super priority lien is not satisfied
at that time, then pursuant to the District of Columbia Code Section 42-1903.13,
the Condominium is foreclosing on six months' worth of assessments and the
related fees and costs. Pursuant to the ruling of the District of Columbia,
Court of Appeals in Chase Plaza Condominium Association, Inc. v. JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A., the sale is NOT subject to the first deed of trust. In that
instance, the Condominium's lien on which the foreclosure is proceeding holds a
higher priority than the lien created by the first deed of trust and if the
foreclosure sale generates insufficient proceeds to satisfy any prior liens, the
foreclosure sale will extinguish the lien created by the prior deed of trust. It
is solely the purchaser's responsibility to determine the condo fees
obligations, priority, significance, and effect on auction sale. The property is
sold as-is as to conditions and occupancy. A deposit of $10,000 will be required
at time of sale, such deposit to be in cash or certified check. All conveyances,
recordings, recordation tax, transfer tax, etc. at purchaser's cost. The balance
of the purchase price, together with interest at the rate of 10% per annum from
date of sale to date of receipt of the balance of the purchase price, must be
paid in cash or by cashier's or certified check and all other terms to be
complied with within 30 days, otherwise deposit is forfeited and the property
may be re-advertised and re-sold at the discretion of the Unit Owner's
Association and at the risk and cost of the defaulting purchaser. Association
shall convey a deed pursuant to 42 D.C. Code 1903.13 and makes no further
representations or warranties as to title. The Association cannot guarantee
clear title or the purchaser's ability to obtain Title Insurance. For this
reason, the purchaser may not be able to obtain financing and must be able to
pay the purchase balance in any case within 30 days. The 30 day period may be
extended for any reason at the sole discretion of the Association. In the event
of failure on the part of the Association to convey such deed, purchaser's sole
remedy shall be the return of the deposit. Brian R. Fellner, FLS, Attorney for

the Condominium may not waive its super priority lien. The above notice has been
sent to all lienholders, and at the time of sale, the Trustee will announce
whether the super-priority lien has been satisfied. If the super priority lien
is satisfied, then the sale will proceed subject to all prior liens,
encumbrances, and/or municipal assessments if any, including the first deed of
trust. If the super priority lien is not satisfied at that time, then pursuant
to the District of Columbia Code Section 42-1903.13, the Condominium is
foreclosing on six months' worth of assessments and the related fees and costs.
Pursuant to the ruling of the District of Columbia, Court of Appeals in Chase
Plaza Condominium Association, Inc. v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the sale is

extinguish the lien created by the prior deed of trust. It is solely the

deed pursuant to 42 D.C. Code 1903.13 and makes no further representations or

SALE: Pursuant to the ruling of the Court of Appeals in Liu v. US Bank, N.A.,
the Condominium may not waive its super priority lien. The above notice has been
sent to all lienholders, and at the time of sale, the Trustee will announce
whether the super-priority lien has been satisfied. If the super priority lien
is satisfied, then the sale will proceed subject to all prior liens,
encumbrances, and/or municipal assessments if any, including the first deed of
trust. If the super priority lien is not satisfied at that time, then pursuant
to the District of Columbia Code Section 42-1903.13, the Condominium is
foreclosing on six months' worth of assessments and the related fees and costs.
Pursuant to the ruling of the District of Columbia, Court of Appeals in Chase
Plaza Condominium Association, Inc. v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the sale is
NOT subject to the first deed of trust. In that instance, the Condominium's lien
on which the foreclosure is proceeding holds a higher priority than the lien
created by the first deed of trust and if the foreclosure sale generates
insufficient proceeds to satisfy any prior liens, the foreclosure sale will
extinguish the lien created by the prior deed of trust. It is solely the
purchaser's responsibility to determine the condo fees obligations, priority,
significance, and effect on auction sale. The property is sold as-is as to
conditions and occupancy. A deposit of $10,000 will be required at time of sale,

within 30 days, otherwise deposit is forfeited and the property may be
re-advertised and re-sold at the discretion of the Unit Owner's Association and

deed pursuant to 42 D.C. Code 1903.13 and makes no further representations or
warranties as to title. The Association cannot guarantee clear title or the
purchaser's ability to obtain Title Insurance. For this reason, the purchaser
may not be able to obtain financing and must be able to pay the purchase balance
in any case within 30 days. The 30 day period may be extended for any reason at
the sole discretion of the Association. In the event of failure on the part of

Appeals in Liu v. US Bank, N.A., the Condominium may not waive its super
priority lien. The above notice has been sent to all lienholders, and at the
time of sale, the Trustee will announce whether the super-priority lien has been
satisfied. If the super priority lien is satisfied, then the sale will proceed
subject to all prior liens, encumbrances, and/or municipal assessments if any,
including the first deed of trust. If the super priority lien is not satisfied
at that time, then pursuant to the District of Columbia Code Section 42-1903.13,
the Condominium is foreclosing on six months' worth of assessments and the
related fees and costs. Pursuant to the ruling of the District of Columbia,
Court of Appeals in Chase Plaza Condominium Association, Inc. v. JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A., the sale is NOT subject to the first deed of trust. In that

higher priority than the lien created by the first deed of trust and if the
foreclosure sale generates insufficient proceeds to satisfy any prior liens, the
foreclosure sale will extinguish the lien created by the prior deed of trust. It
is solely the purchaser's responsibility to determine the condo fees
obligations, priority, significance, and effect on auction sale. The property is
sold as-is as to conditions and occupancy. A deposit of $10,000 will be required
